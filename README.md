This consists of the solutions to the programs of :
1. Implementing an array sorting function in Cairo0.
2. Implementing removing duplicates from an array.
3. Implementing a binary merkle tree builder.
4. Implementing a binary range checker using only ifs â†’ Pass a number in range 0 - 15 the program has to tell you in which quarter the provided number is. Cairo0
5. Implementing bitshifts in Cairo1.
